Are you ok?

# ME
Nod.

# Shiroko
At least you're alive. I thought you were a goner when I saw you lying in the road like that.

# Shiroko
What's that? You fainted from hungry?

# Shiroko
Does that mean you're homeless?
Oh..

# Shiroko
You came here on business,but fainted out of hungry and dehydration when you couldn't find a single shop open?

>dehydration 脱水
>on business 出差

# Shiroko
Well,that's hardly surprising.
It happends all the time around here.It's been a long time since there were businessses open in the neighborhood that offer food and drinks.

>neighborhood 附近
>businesses 商店

# Shiroko
You would have more luck further toward the outskirts.

>toward the outskirt 朝着城市的边缘地带
>further 偏远的

# Shiroko
You're not sure how to get there? So this must be your first time here.
hold on.
Here. Have some of my energy drink.
It's for cycling,but it's all I have right now.Better than nothing.
Wait.Let me get you a cup or something.

>cycling 自行车

# ME
Drink it straight from the bottle.
\*gulp\* \*gulp\* \*gulp\*

>straight 直接的 

# Shiroko
...!
You weren't supposed to ...
Never mind. Don't worry about it.


# ME
Thank her for coming to your rescue.

# Shiroko
Um...
You look like you're an adult from the General Student Council.
Are you here on some kind of academy-related business?
Ours is the only one around.
So you're here to visit Abydos Academy?
Oh.It's been a long time since anyone visited us.
Let me show you the way.It's not too far from here.
What? Too hungry to move?
That's ...a problem.

# ME
Ask for a ride

# Shiroko
But my bike only has one seat.

# ME
Ask hre for a piggyback ride instead.

# Shiroko
Fine。I'd rather do that.
Let me just park my bike.
Hop on.
It's just, I had been cycling for a while. I didn't work up that much of a sweat, but still.
I usualy have to take a shower at school afterward and keep a change of clothes there
>hop on 跳上去
>sweat 汗
>afterward 以后

# Shiroko
Ha? You don't mind?
You actually think I smell good?
What is anyone supposed to say to that ? whatever.As long as you're not going to  complain. Let's go.

# Shiroko
Hold on tight.

>抱紧

# Shiroko
I'm back

# Serika
Welcome back,Shiroko?
Who's that riding on your back?!

# Nonomi
Whoa! Shiroko kidnapped someone!
>kidnapped 绑架

# Ayane
That or it's a dead body!What did you do,Shiroko?!

# Serika
Everyone, calm down. We have to help her hide the body!
Go grab a shovel and pickaxe from the storage!
>grab 取
>shovel 铲子
>pickaxe 镐子

# ME
\*collapses\*
>倒塌 失败 体力不支

# Shiroko
Settle down-- they're alive and breathing.They just came to visit the school.

# Ayane
What? It's not a corpse?

# Serika
A visitor？Are you sure you didn't kidnap them?

# Shiroke
Uh...

# ME
Greet them with a smile

# Nonomi
I'm shocked.We haven't had a visitor in ages.

# Ayane
True...but were we expecting anyone?

# ME
I'm an advisor with Schale.It's nice to meet you.

# Ayane
No way! Are you?!

# Serika
You're with Scahle? The Federal Investigation Club？！

# Nonomi
Wow! That means you got the letter Ayane wrote！
This is great.This means we can finally get more ammo and supplies.

# Ayane
I have to tell Hoshino. Wait... Where is she anyway?

# Seirka
She's taking a nap in the next room.I'll go wake her up.
\*pop\*\*pop\*\*pop\*\*pop\*

# Nonomi
Was that gunfire?

# Helmet Gangster B
Hahahah！

# Helmet Gangster A
They're all out ammo! Finish 'em off.and then take over the school.
>Finish 'em off finish them off 干掉她们
>take over 占领

# Ayane
There's a group approaching the school!
It must be the Kata-Kata Helmet Gang!
>approaching 接近


# Shiroko
Those punks... They have some nerve coming back for more.
>punks 混混
>nerve 胆量

# Serika
I've got hoshino!Now if she'd just wake up
>如果她会醒来

# Hoshino
\*yawn\* Just five more mins

# Ayane
Hoshino! The Helmet Gang is attacking again!By the way,this is Sensei from Schale.

# Hoshino
Ohhh.That's a problem... \*yawn\* Nice to meet you, Sensei.

# Serika
Wake up and get your butt in gear,Hoshino!Literally! We have to defend the school!
>Literally 真的
>get butt in gear 打起精神，行动起来

# Hoshino
\*yarn\*Don't they know it's rude to wake the elderly during naptime?Time to teach those Helmet Gang whippersnappers a lesson.

>elderly 老年人
> Whippersnappers"是一个英语俚语，通常用来形容年轻人或孩子。它的字面意思是“鞭打小树枝的人”，但在这里实际上指那些缺乏经验、不成熟或粗鲁的年轻人。

# Shiroko
Let's get going. Sensei brought us ammo and supplies to use.

# Nonomi
Okay!let's sortie,everyone!
>sortie 出击

# Ayane
I'll navigate us from here.
>navigate 导航

Stay on the back lines and provide support,Sensei!

# Ayane
The kata-Kata Helmet Gang is retreating from the district
>retreating 撤退
>ditrict 区域

# Nonomi
Wow! we won!

# Serika
Hahah! How do you like that,Helmet gang？

# Ayane
