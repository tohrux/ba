#Hoshino
Wow,I can't believe we won!The Helment Gang seemed prettry determined.
>determined adj. 下定决心的，坚定的

#Ayane
You shouldn't say that, Hoshino. Those Thugs would have taken over the school had we lost.

#Shiroko
Sensei gave us edge we needed to turn the tide.We counldn't have done it otherwise.
>otherwise 否则
>turn the tide 逆转局势
>edge 优势；边缘

#Shiroko
Experience was likely the deciding factor.It was amazing how you handled esources,equipment,and support.
>likely 可能的
>deciding 决定性的
>factor 因素

#Hoshino
Sheesh,Shiroko,You sound like you have a schoolgirl crush.Anyway, can I go back to sleep now that it's over?
>crush 迷恋

#Serika
You shouln't tease Shiroko like that,Hoshino!Besides,Haven't you slept enough today?
>tease 取笑

#Nonomi
Someone got yelled at!

#Ayana
Haha.Anyway,we should introduce ourselves,Sensei.
We're the Abydos Foreclosure Task Force.
I'm Ayane,and I'm a first-year in charge of the task force's records and operations.
>in charge of 负责
>task force 任务部门

This is Serika,also a first-yaer.
#Serika 
Hey.

#Ayane 
And these are our second-years:Shiroko and Nonomi.

#Nonomi
Hello,Sensei!

#Shiroko
We met before.

#Shiroko
...Ignore what Hoshino said,okay?

#Ayane
And this here is our president.
Hoshino is our lone third-year.
>lone 单身的；独自的

#Hoshino
Nice to meet you

#Ayane
I'm sure you've noticed by now now that our school is in crisis.That's why I reached out to Schale for help,and you've already managed to come through for us 

>come through 经历；安然度过；获得成功
>in crisis 危机关头
>reached out 表示主动去联系某人或组织以获得支持、建议或协助

#Ayane
Those thugs would have succeeded in taking over the if not for you.We can't thank you enough.

#ME
Ask what the Foreclosure Task Force's purpose is.

#Ayane
The FTF's goal is to bring Abudos back to its former glory.
>former glory 旧时代的荣光

#Nonomi
We're the only club in the school where every single student is a member! I mean, we're the only five students at this school,but still...

All the others either transferred or dropped out and left town.

>transferred 转移的；转校的
>dropped out 退出；退学；脱离

#Shiroko
I don't blame them for leaving Kivotos entirely,with the state that Abudos is in.And now we have to deal with thugs like the Kata-Kata Helmet Gang trying to take over our school.

It's too difficult to defend Abydos on our own,and embarrassing to see the state it's in,if i'm being honest

#Ayane
We would have been in real big trouble this time if Schale hadn't come around to help us

#Hoshino
Seriously.I figured we were done for once we ran out of supplies.That's
some timing you had there,Sensei.
>figured 认为

#Nonomi
At least we don't have to worry about the Helmet Gang anymore!
It pays to have adults in high places!
>it pays to ...是值得的；...有好处的
>high places 高层的

#Shinoko
No.I'm sure it's only a matter of time before they come back.
>只是时间问题

#Seriak
yeah,probably.Man,I hate them.

#Ayane
Who knows how long this will drag out?we have plenty of other things to worry about besides the Helmet Gang.
>besides 除此之外
>plenty 充足 丰富

#Hoshino
I have a plan

#Serika
What the ...?!Hoshino came up with a plan?!
>came up with 想出 提出计划

#Ayane
I'm suprised too！

#Hoshino
I know I'm getting senile in my old age,but you don't have to hurt my feelings.I do my part too, you konw.
>senile 高龄的

#Serika
WEll?Spill it.
>spill it 坦白吧

#Hoshino
If history repeats itself,the HG will attack again in a few days.
So before then,why don't we go on the offensive for once?
They're probably sulking and vulunerable after that last fight.
>offensive 进攻性的 攻击性的
>sulking 闷闷不乐的
>vulnerable 脆弱的；容易受伤的

#Ayane
Y-You mean right now?

#Hoshino
Yeah,now.With Sensei here,we have more than enough supplies to finish the job once and for all.
>more than enough 足够多
>once and for all 一劳永逸

#Shiroko
True.The HG's base is 30 KM from here.
We have plenty of time if we leave now.

#Nonomi
I'm all for it.The last thing they're expecting is for us to strike now.
>strike 攻击
>all for it 完全赞成

#Ayane
I can't deny that,but...what do you think,Sensei?
>deny 拒绝 否定
#ME
I'm on board.

#Hoshino
Great! If Sensei is giving us the green light,then let's hurry up and go.

#Shiroko
Let's strike while the iron is hot.

#Nonomi
Okay! Let's go !

#Ayane
You're now on the HG's turf.
I'm detecting their signal within a 15KM radius.
They must know you're there.Don't let your guard down!
>guard down 放松警惕

#Ayane
They're retreating！Better yet,the HG's supplies,hideout,and ammunition were all taken out.
>retreating 撤退
>ammunition 弹药
>hideout 藏身处

#Shiroko
I bet they'll think twice before attacking us again.

#Hoshino
Great work,everyone.You too,Sensei.
Let's head back to the school
