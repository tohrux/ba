# Ayane
All right.Time for us to begin our regularly scheduled Abydos Foreclosure Task Force meeting.

I'll remind you that Sensei is in attendance today,so I would hope for more decorum than usual

# Nonomi
Okay!⭐

# Shiroko
Naturally.

# Serika
Come on.You say that like we've never taken it seriously before...

# Hoshino
It's good of you to join us,Sensei.

# ME
Thanks for having me.

# Ayane
Okay.Let's get down to business and discuss the key item on our agenda...How do we settle the school's debts?Discuss.

Raise your hand if you'd like to share your thoughts!

# Serika
Ooh! Me! Me!

# Ayane 
Yes,first-year Kuromi Serika.You have the floor.

# Serika
Seriously, again with the formalities? I hate it when you do that...

# Ayane 
Why not?This is our first formal meeting in ages.

# Hoshino
Yeah,what's the big deal? It's nice to pull out all the stops once in a while.

# Shiroko
This is the only time we've had a meeting with Sensei in attendance, to be precise.

# Nonomi
That's right! It's like we're a proper task force now!⭐

# Serika
Fine.You guys do have seniority here, I guess.

# Serika
Moving on! THe school is on the verge of bankruptcy. And I'm the treasurer,in case you forgot,so I really mean it!

Abydos will seriously get shut down at this rate.Got it?

# Hoshino
yeah.

# Serika
We're paying nearly 8 million yen every month alone.We're doing everything we can to hold on,but that much is barely keeping up with the interest.

There's only so much we can do by just arresting wanted criminals or taking care of civilian requests.

We're so reyally screwed unless something changes. What we need is something big! Huge,even!

# Ayane
Something big？

# Serika
This is it! IT's a flier from downtown!

# Hoshino
Let me see here.

# Hoshino
"Ready to becom a boss babe billionaire? Get rich quick with the Germanium Granite Bracelet...Network"? 

# Serika
THat's right! We're all gonna become boss babe billionaires!

# Ayane
。。。

# Serika
 I was downtown recently,and these really cool people invited me to a seminar.They told me all about these amazing germanium bracelets! Did you know they can cleanse your aura and bring you good luck?

# Shiroko
。。。

# Serika
They're so powerful that you can boost your good vibes just by wearing them!And if you can get three other girls who wanna become boss babes like you?

Why are you looking at me like that?

# Hoshino
Proposal denied.

# Serika
What?!Why?!

# Ayane
Serika... Have you ever heard the phrase "phramid scheme" before？

# Shiroko
It's a scam

# Serika
what?

# Ayane 
First，I don't think germanium can possibly affect your luck, if it even exists.Second,If this is such a great business plan,why would they give it away for free at such a fishy-sounding seminar?

# Serika
No way! I already bought two breacelets,so that can't be right!

# Nonomi
Serika is so gullible it's cute!⭐

# Hoshino
Aw,you can be so naive ,Serika,Sweet,but baive.You'd better start wising up,or else you're going to have your life ruined by one of these schemes someday!

# Serika
But...it sounded so convincing.I even skipped lunch so I could buy these...

# Nonomi
There, there,Serika.It's okay.Why don't I treat you to lunch?

# Serika
..Nonomi

# Ayane
Well,then... That's it for Serika's suggestion. Anyone else?

# Hoshino
Me me!

# Ayane
Okay,President Takanashi Hoshino has the floor...

# Hoshino
You know what this school's problem is ? it's the entire student body is just us.More students means more money.Think about Trinity or Gehenna with their five-digit enrollment numbers.Then think about how much they must be raking in with monthly student fees alone!

I suppose ... And?

So we need to increase our enrollment numbers ! That's our top priority.

We'll also get more representatives and have a better say with the General Student Council that way.

# Ayane
I admit you raise a good point,but how do you suggest we do this?

# Hoshino
Simple.We abduct another academy's school bus!

We hijack a bus full of students on their way to school,and we hold them hostage until they agree to transfer their enrollment over to our school!
This is sure to get our enrollment numbers up!

# Shiroko
Intresting! So who's our target? Trinity ? Gehenna? Or is it Millennium?

# HOshino
We'll have to evolve our strategy to fit the target.

Oh,yeah? Well,what about Trinity? No,wait! Let's hit Gehenna!

# Ayane
Wait a second ! We can't possibly boost our enrollment with a stunt like that!

Not to mention the other schools'respective leaderships would surely put up a fight...

# Hoshino
Heh Heh.Oh,would they now?

# Ayane
That wasn't supposed to be a challenge,Hoshino... Can you please try to take this meeting seriously?

# Shiroko
I have an even better idea.

# Ayane
Fine.Go ahead ,second -year student,Sunaookami Shiroko.

# Shiroko
We rob a bank.

# Ayane
What?!

# Shiroko
It's a surefire plan, and we already have ther perfect target.Let's hit the first Central Bank downtown.
I've already mapped out everything from the location of the vault to the positions of the guards,blind spot for the security cameras,and event the armored car's transportation route.

# Ayane
Is that what you've been working so hard on lately?!

We can earn 100 million yen in feve minutes flat. In-and-out,easy.Here , I even brought masks.

# Ayane
Where did you find the time to prepare all of this?

# Hoshino
Whoa!Did you sew these yourself,Shiroko?

# nonomi
Wowie! Check it ouT! Don't I look like a luchador?

# Hoshino
Dang..! IT's so obvious! You gotta risk big to win big! ISn't that what life is all about,Serika?

# Serika
Heck no it isn't! Absolutely not! DENIED!

# Ayane
She's right ! We can't possibly stoop to being criminals.

Pout all your want,Shiroko,but there are some lines that can't be crossed!

# Ayane
Seriously.If no one comes up with a eral idea soon...

# Nonomi
Hey,excuse me ! Me next！

# Ayane
Very well.Second-year Izayoi Nonomi... As long as it doesn't involve scams or breaking the law,you have the floor.

# Nonomi
You got it ! I have the perfect thing, and I promise it isn't illegal or a pyramid scheme. This one is definitely gonna work!
Two words: pop idols! Schoolgirl pop idols,to be exact!

# Ayane
Pop idols..>?!

# Nonomi
You heard me ! it happens all the time in anime.Nothing helps revitalize a school like becoming a pop superstar!If we all break into the industry together as pop idols...

# Hoshino
Denied.

# NOnomi
What...? You don't like that idea either?

# Serika
Why not? You'd definitely have some fans,Hoshino.

# hoshino
Yeah,more like I'd have a bunch of creeps after me.No,thanks.

# Nonomi
But I even came up with a pose..

# Serika
KIDING ME?! THE SWIMSUIT WHAT?! GET REAL!

# Nonomi
Aww.But I worked on it all night...

# Ayane
THis meeting is just goning in circles now.Shouldn't we at least try todecide on something? Anything?

# Hoshino
Why not let Sensei decide? Sensei,which idea do you think we should go with?

# Ayane
No way ! You want to make a decision already? SHOuldn't we at least throw out some better ideas first?

# Hoshino
It'll be fine.IF Sensei backs it, the I'm sure it'll be the right one.

# Ayane
Now wait just a minute.How does that make any sense?

# Serika
I menan, at least this means becoming pop idols is off the table...right?

# Nonomi
Pop idol stardom,here we come!⭐

# Shiroko
hopefully puts mask back on

# ME
We're going bank robbing!

# Ayane
THAT'S what you're picking?! Are you sure?!

# Hoshino
Hahah!I guese we have a winner.Let's go this!

# Nonomi
Yay! That sounds like so much fun!

# Serika
This is a joke ... right ? We aren't really...

# Hoshino
Why not

# Shiroko
Might as well go big or go home.Isn't that right，Ayane？

# Ayane
Obviously

# Serika
Really？

# AYANE
OBVIOUSLY NOT！
\*CRASH\*

# Hoshino
SHe did it! Ayane flipped the table!

# Nonomi
Ahh! Ayane is in berserk mode!Everyone take cover!

# Hoshino
SHe's grown up to be such a stern young lady.It does my old heart proud.

# Ayane
Can't you take this seriously for one second?! I swear,it's like I'M the only MATURE ONE HERE!

aLL YOU four ever do is fool around ! Robbing banks,pyramid schemes..Is this supposed to be some kind of joke?!

# Serika
\*flinches\*

# ENVIROMENT
Ayane continued to chew everyone out for a while.

# Hoshino
Everything's going to be all right,Ayane.We're sorry.okay?
I'll treat you to some ramen to make it up to you.

# Ayane
I'm not angry

# Nonomi
Taht's it.Hush now.Ther's a good girl

# Ayane
Will you stop patronizing me like I'm a child?

# Serika
That's fine and all,but did you guys seriously have to come back here again？

# Shiroko
Want some more chashu,Ayane?

# Ayane
Yesh

# ENVIROMENT
DOORS OPEN

# HARUKA
...

# Serika
Welcome! How many in your party?

# HAruka
Uh.. Excuse me.How much is the cheapest thing on your menu?

# Serika
Our lowest priced dish?
That would be the regualr Shiba Seki Ramen Bowl for 580 yen!
It's our signature dish and super tasty too.

# Haruka
thanks 

# ENVIROMENT
\*door opens\*

# Serika 
Hmm?

# Mutsuki
Heh.We finally found something that costs less than 600 yen!

# Aru
A yen saved is a ye earned.I knew we'd fine one .

# Haruka
Y-You were right. I guess you really do know everyhing,Boss...

# Serika
So,four in your party ? I'll show you to your seats.

# Mutsuki
Oh,nonono,You don't have to do that.We're only only going to order one.

# Serika
Just one...? Still,you may as well be comfortable. Plus we're not very busy at the moment.

# Mutsuki
WEll,isn't that nice of you? Don't mind if we do.
Oh,and can you get us four pairs of chopsticks while you're at it?Thanks.

# Serika
Four pairs? Uh,you're not thinking of splitting a single bowl between the four of you, are you ?

# Haruka
S-Sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm sorry that we're broke and we're poor!

# Serika
What the...?! You don't have to apologize to ME over something like that...

# Haruka
No,really! What's the point of living like this ?We're just a waste of air!Lower than dirt! We never should have come in here.Sorry,sorry,sorry

# Kayoko
\*sign\* For crying out loud... Knock it off,Haruka. You're making a scene

# Serika
Don't say that! Being poor isn't a crime or anything to be ashamed of.You shouldn't be so hard on yourself!

# Haruka
I ..shouln't?

# Serika
You're students! No one expect you to be loaded with cash.Still ,youand your friends scraped enough to share a bowl of ramen together.That's saying someting,isn't it?

Hang tight.I'd be glad to bring it out for you.

# Kayoko
I think she got the wrong idea.

# Mutsuki
Yeah! IT's not like we're beggars.It's just because Aru blew through our cash.

# Aru
That's "Boss" to you.You should know better than to not refer to me by my title,Chief of Staff Mutsuki.

# Mutsuki
Really? You still want us to call you Boss when we're off hte clock?And waht kind of boos can't afford to treat her employeed to more than one measly bowl of ramen?

# Aru
...

# Kayoko
Maybe you should've thought of that before blowing all of our money on hired goons

# Aru
Heh. Would you expect me to do anything less? Be grateful there was enough left for a bowl of ramen.

# Kayoko
You could have negotiated to make sure there was enough left for four, you konw...

# Mutsuki
Just admit that you forgot to account for dinner in today's expenses,Aru.

# Aru
Heh,heh,heh...

# KAyoko
I get why you would want to reduce the risk factor of this operation.You're right about not underestimating the target.They aren't jobbers like the Helmet Gang.

# Kayoko
But really,Boss? Are these Abydos students relly worth blowing our entire budget on hiring extra muscle?

# Aru
They could be...

# Mutsuki
Aru probably doesn't even konw.That's why she hired those goons--because she's chicken.

# Aru
Who are you calling a chicken?! I'm just being careful and covering our bases!

Failure is not an option.You all know Problem Solver 68's motto:Expect the unexpected.

# Kayoko
THis is the first I'm hearing about a motto.

# Mutsuki
Pretty sure she just made that up on the spot.

# Aru
Shut up!I'll take you all out for sukiyaki once we finish this job and get a paid. So you'd better go all out!

# HAruna
Sukiyaki! wait,what's that？

# Kayoko
It's dish that adults like... and really expensive.

# Haruka
W-Wow.I don't know if dirt liek me could appreciate it,then Would I have to sacrifice my life afterward for overindulging?

# Aru
Heh heh.Problem Solver is an industry titan at this point.We deserve only the best,wouldn't you agree?

# Mutsuki
Heh! YOu're so ambitious ,Aru.

# Aru
I told you to call me Boss!

# Serika
Order up！The bowl's hot,so be careful!

# Mutsuki
What the...This bowl is huge.

# Kayoko
It looks like it could feed ten people...

# Haruka
Uh,are you sure this is the right order? we don't have the money to pay for something like this...

# Serika
This is exactly what you ordered: a  plain  580-yen Shiba Seki Ramen Bowl.
Is't that right，Master?

# Mastwe Shiba
Well,I might have over dilled a smidge, but that's all right.

# Serika
Master says it's all good,so don't worry! Enjoy your meal!

# Haruka
W-Wow...

# Mutsuki
I say we eat first and ask questions later.Chopsticks ready!

# Aru 
I didn't see this coming,but it'd be rude of us to send it back

# Mutsuki
Let's dig in!

# ENVIROMENT
\*slurp\*

# Aru
...!

# Haruka
I-It's so yummy!

# Mutsuki
Not bad at all.Who knew there was such a good ramen shop out here in the boonies

# Nonomi
I know,right? Isn't it the best?

# mutsuki
Huh? Weren't you sitting at the table next to us?

# Nonomi
Yep! The ramen here is the best around. People come from all over just to get a taste of it.

# Aru
I can see why. I've been to my fair share of shops,and ramen this good is hard to find.

# Ayane
We're regulars here.Sorry to interrupt your meal,but we wanted to say it's good to see students from other schools come here and see the light

# Shiroko
That uniform you're wearing is Gehenna's,right?That's a long trip.

# Nonomi
Girls sharing a bowl of ramen together like this.It's little nostalgic,isn't it?

# Hoshino
Wasn't that a bowl of udon?

# Kayoko
(...)
(Their uniforms...)

# Mutsuki
(Hey,you're right)

# Aru
Haha! I never expected to run into fellow connoisseurs here.Isn't life wonderfully unpredictable sometimes?

# Mutsuki
(Something tells me Aru hasn't put two and two together yet.)

# Kayoko
SHould I tell her ?

# Mutsuki
(Nah.This is interesting.Let's see what happens)

# Kayoko
(...)
