I spotted a familiar face while walking through the neightborhood near Abydos.
>spotted 发现

Ugh,It's you again.

#Me
Good morning!
>act like 举止像

#Serika
 wait,no! Don't act like we are friends!
 Hmph,Whatever.
 > 随便你怎么说

Don't you have anything better to do than loiter around so early in the morning ? And you call yourself an adult...
>loiter 虚度；闲逛

#ME
Heading to school,Serika?

#Serika
What's with you ?! Stop acting like you know me !
What I do is none of your business.
Look at you hanging around with nothing better to do.I hope I nerver grow up to be as animless as you.
Why don't you buzz off and bother someone else ? I'm busy.
>buzz off 

What? You want to walk to school together?
why on earth should I go with you?
Besides,it's our day off.I don't have class.
>day off 休息日
Huh?Then where am I going ? what business is that of yours?
I'm outta here,Bye!

#ME
Serika ran away.
Follow her

#Serika
Huh? Why are you followin me?
You wanna know where am I going ?
What are you talking about ? Go away,you stalker!
Ugh!Fine!I'll just tell you.
I'm going to my part-time job.
I don't have the freedom to just slack off all day like you do.
I have money to make.
There,happy now? So stop following me!
>slack off偷懒

#ME
follow her

#Serika
Ugh.You're so annoying.
>annoying 烦人

What? Where do I work?
Would you go away already，you idiot?! You're cruising for a bruising if you don't leave me alone.
>你能不能走开，白痴？！如果你不离我远点儿，就等着挨揍吧。

#Serika
Welcome to Shiba Seki Ramen!

How many are in your party? I'll show you to your seats.
Just a minutes! Extra noodles for table three!

What the...?!

#Nonomi
HEllo!Table for five!

#Ayane 
Haha.Hello,Serika...

#Shiroko
Hey.

#Serika
What are you guys doing here?

#Hoshino
Heh! We knew you'd be here.

#ME
hi

#Serika
Sensei is with you too...?Iknew you were staking me!

#Hoshino
Don't blame Sensei.We figured this was the only place you might work.so we just came by.
>came by 路过

#Serika
So it was you,Hoshino?

#Master SHiba
Are these your Abydos classmates? Serika? Stop with the chit-chat and take their order
>点菜

#Serika
Y-yes,sir.Follow me.I'll take you to your table.

#Nonomi
Okay! over here,Sensei! sit next to me

#Shiroko
Um..Or you can sit here if you want/

#Serika
It's too narrow!Sitting that close can't possibly be comfortable for sensei. Move a little this way.

#Shiroko
No,it should be fine.Right ?sensi?

#Serika
But there are plenty of seats! can't you all just sit like NORMAL people?

#Nonomi
Your uniform is adorable,Serika!

#Hoshino
I didn't know you were into the kind of stuff.Chose to work here solely based on the uniform,did ya?
>solely 仅仅
>be into 喜欢；对...有兴趣

#Serika
Wh-What are you talking about ? It had nothing to do with that!
I just used to be a regular here, that's all...
>used to be a regular过去时常客

#Hoshino
I bet I could fetch a pretty yen if I sold pictures of you in that uniform,Serika.What do you say,Sensei? Wanna be my first customer?

#Ayane 
Knock it off,Hoshino...

#Shiroko
So, how long have you been working here?

#Serika
Maybe about a week.

#Nonomi 
Now i get why you were running off from time to time.
I guess it was because you were working.
>time to time 时不时

#Serika
Would you all shut up already and place an order?

#Hoshino 
I think what you meant was,"May I take your order?" Right,Serika?
We're your guests here after all.

#Serika
Ugh..May I take your order?

#Nonomi
I'll have the chashu ramen,pls

#Shiroko
One shio ramen

#Ayane 
Hmm...I'd like the miso ramen.

#Hoshino
I want the special miso!With extra grilled chashu!

#Hoshino
Order whatever you want,Sensei.Shiba Seki Ramen is one of the best remaining restaurants in Abydos.

#Serika
Did you all bring your own money?You're not just going to make Nonomi pay again，are you?

#Nonomi
It's not like I mind .I'm still way under my card's credit limit.
>still way 仍然

#Hoshino
Nah,we can't make you do that.Sensei is going to pick the tab up today!
right?
>pick the tab up 埋单
What ? No one told you? Hha!well now you know!

#ME
Run away

#Hoshino
Where do you think YOU'RE going?
You've got credit to burn,right ? This is our chance to make use of it

#Ayane 
You can't force Sensei to pay. We only came because you said it was your treat,Hoshino
>force 强迫
>treat 请客

#Hoshino
This is perfect chance for Sensei to treat their students.Wallet-flexing opportunities like this don't come around every day.
>Wallet-flexing 钱包收缩
>opportunities 机会

#Nonomi
(Here,Sensei.Just pay with this card.)
(Huh? Are you sure you don't want to? But..)

#Me
I ended up paying for everyone's meals.

#Hoshino
That  was delicous,Sensei!

#Shiroko
Thanks.

#Serika
Would you all get out of here already? And never come back!You're nothing but a bunch of busybodies.
>bunch of busybodies 多管闲事的人

#Ayane
Hhahah！ See you tomorrow，Serika

#Serika
I hate you ！ I won't forget this

#Hoshino
Hhaha! SHe's got a lot of spunk,eh?
>spunk 活力
