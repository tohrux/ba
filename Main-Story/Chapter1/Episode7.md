# Ayane 
Well done,everyone
Will you be all right,Serika?
# Serika
Uh,I'll be fine.Never better..

# Shiroko
I'll take her to the infirmary.

# Hoshino
I'd be more concerned if she WAS still standing after getting hit by a Flak41 artillery shell.She better get some rest.

# Ayane
It could have been much worse had Sensei not been here...

# Nonomi
Uh.Tracking down Serika's location was a piece of cake thanks to you,Sensei.You're always so reliable!

> a piece of cake 一块蛋糕

# Hoshino
Oh,really？All in a day's work for stalker,huh?

# Ayane
...Excuse me,everyone.Could I have your attention?
I was looking into the tank parts we collected in battle.It turns out they're from an illegal model that is prohibited within Kivotos.
I'll have to dig a little deeper,but right now it looks like the Helmet Gang has gained access to weapons that should be contraband

>contraband 违禁品

I bet we can find out who those hooligans answer to if we analyze the distribution channels for these parts!

# Ayane
Bingo .That,and also why a minor criminal organization is targeting our school so obsessively...

>obsessively着迷的
>minor criminal 小的犯罪团伙

# Hoshino
Sounds good to me.Let's proceed a little cautiously and see where this leads
> cautiously 慎重地，谨慎地

Is this the best an organized crime group can do？Providing them with a tactical tank was a waste.
You'd think a gang of students would be able to hanlde some other students
In that case,I'll simply have to enlist the services of more skilled professionals

# Serika
Huh?
Wait...Sensei?!What are you doing here?

#ME
I came to see how you were doing.

#Serika
Oh,I'm fine. I should't be spending so much time lying around doing nothing anyway.
I don't want to worry Ayane or the others too much.Plus,I have my part-time job to go to.
You don't have to worry about me so much! I'm fine,really.

#ME
that's relief

#Serika
Uh,so...By the way!
The thing is...
Looking back on it,I don't think I ever thanked you,Sensei... 
S-So.,.thanks. For all the help and stuff
But still!Don't assume this has done anything to actually help our school!
We're gonna settle this debt if it's the last thing we do!
Wh-What?!What's with that smug look on your face?
>smug 得意

Whatever...I'll see you tomorrow!
