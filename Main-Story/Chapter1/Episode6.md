# Ayane
Serika?Are you there,Serika?

# ENVIROMENT
\*ding dong\*

# Ayane 
Are you there? Why haven't you been answering your phone?
Where does she keep her spare keys...?

# Ayane
What's going on,Serika?Are you still not home yet?
This is so strange
Could it be...?

# Nonomi
What about her phone ?

# Ayane
It's been turned off a few hours now...

# Shiroko
Her boss said she clocked out and left like everything was normal.
Did she never make it home?
> clocked out 打开下班
> make it home 回家

# Nonomi
Nothing like this has ever happened before.She always gets home safely...

# Shiroko
You don't think...  Was it the Helmet Gang?

# Ayane
what?

# Shiroko
A possibility, but let's not jump to conclusions.Hoshino and Sensei are still investigating.
> investigating调查
> conclusions结论

# ENVIROMENT
\*open door\*

# Hoshino
Sorry to keep you waiting.

# Ayane
Hoshino!Sensei!

# ME
We're back

# Shirono
Did you find out what happened?

# Hoshino
Sensei was able to log in to the General Student Council's central communication network.
>central 中央的

# Ayane
You are able to get into their network? Wow.Sensei's the real deal...
>deal 真正的行家

# Hoshono
It's secret,though.We're in big trouble if they catch us.

# Ayane
Wait! Does that mean you didn't ask for permission?!

# ME
It's fine.It's for Serika's safety.

# Hoshino
This is the last known location of Serika's phone before it went offline.
>last known location 最后已知位置

# Nonomi
That's one of the neighborhoods that's become more desolate,isn't it?

# Shiroko
It's more like an abandoned wasteland.There's no one there to enforce public safety, so there are a lot of outlaws skulking about.
>skulk 鬼鬼祟祟

# Ayane
Right.We found that Helmet Gangs members lived in those areas while researching risk factors surrounding the school.
>factors因素

# Ayane
So it really was them!

# Hoshino
They must have kidnapped Serika while she was on her way home and taken her to their hideout.

# Shiroko
Likely still bitter over our last battle.Maybe they took Serika hostage as a way to retaliate.
>bitter over 感到愤怒或不满
>take hostage 扣留人质
>retaliate 报复

# Nonomi
Probably!! We have to go save her!

# Hoshino
There's no time to waste!

# ME
let's go
