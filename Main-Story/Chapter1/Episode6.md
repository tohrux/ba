# Ayane
Serika?Are you there,Serika?

# ENVIROMENT
\*ding dong\*

# Ayane 
Are you there? Why haven't you been answering your phone?
Where does she keep her spare keys...?

# Ayane
What's going on,Serika?Are you still not home yet?
This is so strange
Could it be...?

# Nonomi
What about her phone ?

# Ayane
It's been turned off a few hours now...

# Shiroko
Her boss said she clocked out and left like everything was normal.
Did she never make it home?
> clocked out 打开下班
> make it home 回家

# Nonomi
Nothing like this has ever happened before.She always gets home safely...

# Shiroko
You don't think...  Was it the Helmet Gang?

# Ayane
what?

# Shiroko
A possibility, but let's not jump to conclusions.Hoshino and Sensei are still investigating.
> investigating调查
> conclusions结论

# ENVIROMENT
\*open door\*

# Hoshino
Sorry to keep you waiting.

# Ayane
Hoshino!Sensei!

# ME
We're back

# Shirono
Did you find out what happened?

# Hoshino
Sensei was able to log in to the General Student Council's central communication network.
>central 中央的

# Ayane
You are able to get into their network? Wow.Sensei's the real deal...
>deal 真正的行家

# Hoshono
It's secret,though.We're in big trouble if they catch us.

# Ayane
Wait! Does that mean you didn't ask for permission?!

# ME
It's fine.It's for Serika's safety.

# Hoshino
This is the last known location of Serika's phone before it went offline.
>last known location 最后已知位置

# Nonomi
That's one of the neighborhoods that's become more desolate,isn't it?

# Shiroko
It's more like an abandoned wasteland.There's no one there to enforce public safety, so there are a lot of outlaws skulking about.
>skulk 鬼鬼祟祟

# Ayane
Right.We found that Helmet Gangs members lived in those areas while researching risk factors surrounding the school.
>factors因素

# Ayane
So it really was them!

# Hoshino
They must have kidnapped Serika while she was on her way home and taken her to their hideout.

# Shiroko
Likely still bitter over our last battle.Maybe they took Serika hostage as a way to retaliate.
>bitter over 感到愤怒或不满
>take hostage 扣留人质
>retaliate 报复

# Nonomi
Probably!! We have to go save her!

# Hoshino
There's no time to waste!

# ME
let's go

# Serika
Ugh...
Where am I ? Was I kidnapped?!
Ow...My head.
Is this the back of a truck?
>truck 卡车
The Helmet Gang... Where could they be taking me ?
It's dark,but there is a little bit of light coming throught the crack in the door.
Maybe I can see something outside...
Sand..and a railroad?
Does that mean we're in the desert on the outskirt of Abydos?
No... There's nothing but wasteland out here and no way to get a signal.
>wasteland 荒地
I won't be able to contact the others even if I do manage to escape.
>manage 设法做到
>even if 即使
What should I do ? They must be worried sick about me.
>worried sick 非常担心
Are they going to bury me somewhere in the desert so no one can find me?
>bury 埋葬
Maybe the team well think I bailed on them and left like all the other students...
>bail 摆脱 离开
Will they think I betrayed them?
>betray 出卖；背叛
Is this how I'm going to die...?
No.I can't let that happen...

What's that?!
What the heck? An explosion? Why did that truck blow up out of nowhere?!
>out of nowhere 突然出现
>blow up爆炸
Where are these shells coming from?
>shells 贝壳

# Ayane
I've located Serika!

# Serika
A-Ayane?

# Shiroko
I have eyes on her! Repeat:visual on Serika!She's crying!

# Hoshino
What?! Our little Serika is crying?Aw, she must have missed us.
I had no idea she cared so much!

# Serika
Ugh! You guys are so annoying! I wasn't crying!

# Shiroko
False! I can confirm there were tears in your eyes just moments ago!

# Nonomi
Don't cry,Serika!We're here now,and we promise to dry those tear-soaked cheeks of yours!

> soaked 湿透的 
>
> cheek 脸颊
>
> dry 使...变干

# Serika

Damn it! Could you be any more grating!! I said I wasn't crying, so shut up already!

> grating 恼人的 ；刺耳的

# Me

I'm glad to see you're okay.

# Serika

What？Your're here too,Sensei?! But why?

# Me

I'm a stalker,remember?

# Serika

What are you talking about? You're such a perv!

> perv 变态

# Hoshino

Heh.Our damsel in distress has been rescued.She's gonna be fine.

> distress 危难；险情
>
> damsel 少女

# Ayane

Thank goodness.I was so worried about you,Serika.

# Shiroko

It's too soon to let our guard down.We may have stopped the truck,but we're still in enemy territory.

> territory领土

# Hoshino

You're right.Reinforcements are likely on the way now that the truck's been destroyed.

> Reinforcements增援

# Ayane

Multiple hostiles from the kata-kata Helmet Gang confirmed ahead!

> hostile 敌人

I also see more than a handful of super heavy firearms!They're steadilly forming a dragnet!

# Hoshino

Me and my big mouth! Ugh.What do you say we push our way through these losers

# Serika

Be careful.Those goons have a modified heavy tank.

> goon暴徒；呆子

# Shiroko

Yeah,we know.It's refurbished Flak 41.

> refurbished 翻新
