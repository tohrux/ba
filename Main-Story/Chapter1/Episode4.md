#Ayane
Welcome back,everyone.Great work today.

#Hoshino
We're back!

#Serika
Thanks,Ayane.You too

#Nononmi
We finally took down the HG.It should be smooth sailing from here.
>smooth sailing 一帆风顺

#Shiroko
More like we can finally get back to more important matters.

#Serika
Hah!All we have to focus on now is paying back the debt!
>pay back 偿还
>debt 债务

#Serika
Thanks for your help,Sensei.We won't forget what you did for us.

#ME
debt?

#Serika
Wait...Shoot!

#Ayane
W-Well,the thing is...

#Serika
Stop right there! Not another word,Ayane!

#Hoshino
Why not,Serika?It's not like it's a secret.

#Serika
That doesn't mean we should go tellin everyone!

#Hoshino
It isn't though we're guilty of anthing.Besides,Sensei is one of us now.

#Shiroko
Hoshino is right,Serika.Sensei is responsible trustworthy,even.
>Hoshino是对的，Serika。老师是值得信赖的，甚至还负有责任。

#Serika
I know, but they're still an outsider.
>outsider 局外人

#Hoshino
I'm not saying Sensei can solve this problem on our behalf，but they're the only adult we have to turn to.
>on behalf 代表xx
>turn to 求助

#Hoshino
Maybe we can come up with a solutin if we discuss it with Sensei,even.
Or do you have any better ideas,Serika?

#Serika
Well...
Sensei just showed up out of nowwhere!Why would an adult care about our problems ,anyway?
>out of nowhere 莫名其妙的出现
>showed up 出现

We're always taken care of ourselves! Why do we suddenly need  to be supervised?
I don't want any part of this!

#Ayane
Serika?

#Nonomi
I'll go talk to her.

#Hoshino
...
Back to the matter at hand... Our School owes quite a bit of money to a loan company.It's a challenge,but not exactly an uncommon problem either.
>owes 负债
>quite a bit 相当多
>loan 贷款

The real issue is... that it's over 900 million yen.

#Ayane
It's 962,350,000 yen to be exact.
That's amount that Abydos--no.That's the amount the FTF has taken upon itself to pay back.
>take upon 承担
>amount 金额

The loan company will foreclose on the school and shutter it permanently if we don't repay them.
>如果我们不偿还贷款，贷款公司就会取消学校的赎回权并永久关闭。 
>repay 偿还
>permanetly 永久的
>shutter it 关闭

#Shiroko
All except for us,that is.
>except 除此

#Ayane
The debt is the source of everything that's wrong.It's why the school is on the brink of closure, why the students left,and why the town is so desolate...
>closure 关闭
>desolate 荒无人烟的

#ME
Ask about what happened

#Ayane
You mean how the dept was accrued in the first place?
>accrued 积累

There was a sandstorm in the desert surrounding the school several years ago.
Sandstorms are common in the Abydos region,but that particular storm was devastating.
>particular 特别的
>devastating 毁灭性的

Some areas were completely buried in sand, and it just kept piling up.
>piling up 堆积
>buried 埋葬的

The school had to raise a lot of funds for disaster relief...
>funds 资金
>disaster 灾难
>relief 缓解

...but there wasn't a single bank that would give such a large loan.

#Shiroko
So the school was forced to turn to loan sharks...
>forced to被迫

#Ayane
Exactly.They were looking to take the easy way out and pay the money back quickly...
>take the easy way out 捷径

...but the sandstorms only worsened as the years went on.Despite the school's best intentions,the situation just kept getting worse.

> as the years went on 随着岁月的迁移
> worsened 恶化
> despite 尽管
> intentions 目的
> situation 情况

Today,more than half of Abydos is under sand and the debt keeps growing.

We're barely able to pay the interest every month.We can't even afford ammunition or school supplies.
>interest 利息

#SHiroko
I can sympathize with Serika's frustations.No one has ever cared enough to ask about our situation before, let alone reach out to help.
>frustations 挫败感
>sympathize 体谅
>let alone 更不用说
>reach out 伸出

#Hoshino
That's the long and short of it.
Now that you've helped us scare the HG away，we can return our focus to paying off the debt.

>pay off 偿清
>scare away 吓跑

Even if we appoint you as our club's advisor,you don't have to trouble yourself with our debt. It was kind of you to listen to our story.
>Even if 即使
>appoint 任命

We're not trying to pressure you. You've already helped us enough.
>pressure 压力

#ME
We're in this together now. I won't abandon you.

#Ayane 
You don't have to say all that...
But thank you for doing so anyway,sensei
>do so 这样做

#Hoshino
Listen to you being so noble.You're really going to insist on helping...
>noble 高尚的
>insist 坚持

#Ayane
I feel so relieved.There's some hope if we have Schale's support.
>relieved 放心的

#Shiroko
True.Things are looking up,at least.
>look up 改善

#Nonomi
Serika，where are you?
