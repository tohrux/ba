Good morning, Sensei!

#Arona 
A lot of people are starting to talk about Schale, and we're received letters from other students asking for help.

#Arona 
That's a great sign,and it means there's a lot of work for us to do!

#Arona
Um, but...there's this one letter we got.

#Arona
I think you should take a look.

#ME
Read the letter

#THE LETTER
To the advisor of the federal Investigation Club.
Hello. My name is Okisora Ayane,and I'm a student at Abydos High School.
I'm writing this letter because I want to ask for your help.
Our academy is being harassed.
One of the local gangs has been tormenting us.

致联邦调查俱乐部的顾问：
您好。我叫Okisora Ayane，是Abydos高中的学生。
我写这封信是因为我想请求您的帮助。
我们学校正遭受骚扰。
当地一个帮派一直在折磨我们。

It's long story,but we think...
...this gang is after school building itself.
The students are doin their best to stop them.
It's only a matter of time before we run out of ammunition and supplies, though.
At this rate, the school will fall to them for sure.
Can you help us,sensei?

这是一个漫长的故事，但我们认为......这个帮派是在追求学校建筑本身。学生们正在尽力阻止他们。然而，我们很快就会耗尽弹药和物资了。按照这种速度，学校肯定会被他们攻陷。

>"be after" 的固定搭配表示“追求、寻找”的意思

>It's only a matter of time before we run out of ammunition and supplies, though.：though 在此处相当于 however 或者 nevertheless

>At this rate,... ：at this rate 表示按照目前的情况发展下去，在英文中常用来表达对未来可能性或结果的预测。

#Arona
Hmm.. Abydos Hight School, huh?

#Arona
It used to have a large,thriving district,but it fell on hard times due to climate change.

它曾经有一个繁荣的大区，但由于气候变化而陷入困境。

>原文中使用了过去式 "used to" 表示这个地方以前存在过一个繁荣的大区。接着用了动词不定式结构 "have >a large, thriving district" 来描述这个大区的情况。然后使用了连词 "but" 引出转折，说明由于气候变化，这个地方遭受到了困难。最后使用了介词短语 "due to climate change" 来解释原因。

#Arona
The district was so big that people would even get lost in the middle of town

#Arona 
Heehee.That must sound ridiculous.How does someone get lost in the middle of modern civilization?

>ridiculous: adj. 可笑的，荒谬的

>middle of modern civilization: 现代文明的中心

#Arona
I'm sure that was just an urban legend.

>urban legend:都市传说

#Arona
Anyway,I can't believe the academy is being bullied by some lowlife gang.It sounds pretty serious.

>bullied:bully过去分词，霸凌
>lowlife:卑下的人

#Arona
I wonder what brought this on.

>brougnt on:引起，导致

#ME
I need to go to Abydos.

#Arona
You want to head there right away?

>head there:前往

#Arona
You really don't back down, doe you ?
All right,Good luck!


#Me
I eventually arrived in Abydos，but got lost in the middle of the district. It took days to find the school
