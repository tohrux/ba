Let's go down Yuuka's list.First order of business is...
Repairing the damaged cheer bot.

>downplay 轻描淡写；贬低；低估
>severely 严重地
>minor 微小地

At this point,it might be better for us to just remake the whole thing from scratch.

# Noa
I know.But I've called in the best of the best for this daunting task.
>daunting 令人畏惧地 气馁的
>called in 召集
